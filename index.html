                  I am a recent graduate from Stanford where I received my Master's
                  Degree in Computer Science with a focus in Computer & Network Security and Bachelor's Degrees in Computer Science with a focus 
                  in Artificial Intelligence and Classical Music.
                  <br><br>
                  I'm interested in working in collaborative, creative spaces where I can combine my left and right sides of my brain. I'm deeply interested in
                  exploring non-contrived ways to intersect fashion, music, and technology.
                  <br><br>
                  I am both a classical orchestral timpanist/percussionist and a conductor. More recently, I am interested in production, sound design, and combining acoustic
                  instruments with electronics.

                          I have a complicated relationship with the snare drum. It’s a peculiar instrument,
                          calling for repeated rhythmic strokes on a drum surface undergirded by wires,
                          whereas I gravitate towards the elements of melody and harmony offered by mallet
                          instruments. My teachers, however, have always challenged and inspired me to
                          search for singable phrases hidden in snare drum music. Evan Chapman’s Buttonwood
                          is intrinsically expressive and avant-garde. He composed the piece with the intention
                          of evoking the repinique – a Brazilian metal drum played with one hand and one stick
                          – by incorporating several different timbres: sounds that are low, high, short, long,
                          warm, and harsh. He instructs the performer to mount the snare drum upside-down
                          with the wire strainers running horizontally. The performer has a thirteen-note key
                          with various instructions, such as scraping the wire or tapping the rim.

                          Whenever I bring friends to the symphony, I often encounter the same anxious refrain
                          – what do I wear? Over the past few years, I’ve developed a fascination with haute
                          couture. This project reimagines the symphony hall as a kind of public runway and
                          an open and expressive social forum where audiences can participate in a creative
                          project alongside the musicians, allowing high fashion to be enjoyed in arenas outside
                          of the Met Gala or designer runways. To that end, I have partnered with the
                          exceptionally talented Stanford designer Vincent Hao and models Ava Ford and Blake
                          Pigott to envision a modernist take on Victorian formal wear. I am thrilled to present
                          my multimedia interpretation of Buttonwood, synthesizing my respective creative
                          passions.

                          The Septet, composed thirty years later than the more commonly played Octet, is a
                          later work of Igor Stravinsky, though still initially reflecting elements of his earlier
                          Neoclassical idiom. The Septet opens with a traditional sonata form in the first
                          movement with polished contrapuntal elements. The piece then departs from the
                          Neoclassical sound in the second movement, though preserving “classical”
                          compositional techniques, as indicated by the heading Passacaglia: a movement based
                          on a repeating bass line, originally tonal in design, though no longer the case here.
                          By the third movement (Gigue), Stravinsky experiments with serialism. At its core,
                          serialism involves an ordered collection of musical elements, such as pitches or
                          rhythms, arranged in a specific order or “series” that is then used as the basis for
                          composing a piece through manipulation and transformation, instead of the
                          traditional organizing principle of tonal scales and chord progressions. In this way,
                          Stravinsky’s Septet contributed to his departure from traditional tonal reference points
                          in his earlier Neoclassical style.

                          I’ve been fortunate enough to work closely with Paul Phillips as my conducting mentor
                          and professor. Over the past four years, I’ve both played Stravinsky’s symphonic
                          repertoire under Maestro Phillips’ baton in the Stanford Symphony Orchestra and
                          studied the scores of his other works as a conducting student. I am honored to include

                      Johann Sebastian Bach’s Solo Cello Suites follow the traditional form of the German
                      instrumental suite – an intricate prélude followed by a set of dances: allemande,
                      courante, sarabande, minuet, and gigue. Bach’s dance suites have a rich social history,
                      reflecting aristocratic forms of entertainment emulated by many among the middle
                      and upper classes during the European Baroque era. The first cello suite opens with
                      a familiar steady-paced prélude, followed by a balance of lively and slower dances.
                      Throughout my time at Stanford, I’ve prepared many of these individual dances from
                      various suites for marimba and I am thrilled to program the first cello suite in its
                      entirety.
                    </p>
                    <p class="minimalist-text">
                      Bach’s compositional genius predates the popularization of the marimba in the
                      mid-20th century by about three hundred years. Nonetheless, percussionists have
                      adapted transcriptions of the unaccompanied violin, lute, and cello suites to the
                      versatile and wide-ranging instrument, utilizing its five-octave range to highlight
                      the marimba’s virtuosity and the musicality of Bach’s compositions. This is not to say,
                      however, that a marimbist approaches Bach in the same way that a cellist would.
                      Marimbists must consider the instrument’s inability to sustain pitches as a bowed
                      string instrument would be able to; the performer might choose to execute a roll –
                      which involves repeatedly hitting the note to imitate the sustain of a bow – rather
                      than allow for the natural rosewood bar to vibrate into the metal resonators below
                      and dissipate in only a matter of seconds. Marimbists may also use the dexterity of
                      four mallets to achieve polyphony, or the simultaneity of multiple notes at once.
